# AR Drawing app

An app that lets you draw in 3D space with multiple colors.

The app is still in a buggy state so keep that in mind.

Before actually drawing any lines you should give the app some time to map the enviroment, it is recommended to move the camera around the area for approx. 7 seconds.
